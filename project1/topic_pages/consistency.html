  <h1> Consistency</h1>
  <h3>Design</h3>
     <p>The design of the website needs to be consistent. Meaning keeping the visual design of the website consistent. Once a user becomes familiar with a website they can spot when one thing is out of place. For example, the text font changes from one page to another changing. This causes the userâ€™s experience on the website not to be enjoyable. Web developers need to be able to look at the smallest details to make sure anything is the same. Web developers have to make sure the font, logos, pictures, headings, and much more all look the same from any page the user goes on. By using different design details on each page can cause the user to get confused and not visit the site anymore.</p>

  <h3> Functional Consistency</h3>  
      <p>The way the website works also needs to be consistent. The user excepts all the functions of the website to work perfectly. For example, a link working on one page but not another is not a good standard of consistency. The user wants and needs things to be predictable when they interact with the website. Web developers need to make sure the user feels comfortable with the website. Also, the website needs to be able to work across different applications and technology. Your website needs to be able to work on phones and computers the same way. For, example having the search box work the same across different forms of technology. Web developers can mislead or lose the user if they do not have functional consistency.</p> 
  
  <h3> Content</h3>
      <p>The content on the website should be consistent with the theme, quality, and mood If the content of the website of more laid back then the website should reflect happy feelings. If the content is about serious information, then the website should reflect how serious the information is. For example, when reading the news online the webpage needs to look clean, informative, and serious. If the webpage of a news site had neon colors, bold font, and weird images no one would trust that news site. The quality of the content needs to match the quality of the website. If you have this great article but the web page on its own is lacking, then no user will read the article because the webpage is not consistent with the article. Also, the content is posted on a website should always be interesting and of good quality. The consistency of the content can affect if a user will visit the website again. </p>
