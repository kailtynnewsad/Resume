## Web Development I

**Project 1**:

The purpose of this project was to do research on two principles of good web design. Then create an informational webpage on thoese two principles. The project includes an index.html, header.css, color.html, consistency.html, information.html, index.css, color.css, consistency.css, information.css, and normalize.css file.
The index.html had to have an logo, title, nav bar, decriptions/images of the two principles, aside section about the us, and a footer. We had to follow the professors layout of this page. The color.html page gives in detail why color is any important to web design. This page needed to have a main heading and three main points. Each main point has an heading and two robust paragraphs. The text for this page was styled by using text columns. The consistency.html file has a main heading and three main points. Each main point should have a heading and 1-2 paragraphs. The informational.html file provides a bulleted list of at least four web resources (at least two for each design principle). Each web page must have the same header and nav section as index.html. All pages must have the same color scheme and font style. The logo for the web site should link back to the index.html file.

**Project 3**:

The purpose for this project was to create a web site where the user can order a baseball hat and have a choose of three different teams. We had to follow the professors layout for the project. The index.html includes radio buttons that change the image hat when a different team is selected. Text boxes where the user included name, email, phone, and any special instructions. If the user does not fill in the name, email, or phone information than error message will be displyed. Also, if the user enters their phone number not in the right format it will also give an error message. This page also includes radio buttons that all or none could be seleted for the mailing list. At the bottom of the page their is an submit order and a clear form buttons. The submit order button will only work if the name, phone, and email are filled in right. If the information is filled in right then anothere page will display showing the date and time the order was submitted. The clear form button will set everything to the deafult (forms will clear and radio button for team hats will be set to Cincinnati). Also, all labels for radio buttons are clickable.
