<p>One of my favorite vacations I have taken with my family is to Plymouth, Massachusetts. Located off the coast of Massachusetts and is only fourty minutes south of Boston. My family took our dogs with us on this vacation. We were able to rent a beach house that was located on a private beach that allowed dogs. Plymouth has many musuems and landmarks that show the history if the town. They also many great restaurants loacted in town too. </p>
